Bite 190. Parse income distribution from Latin America XML â˜†
In this Bite you are going to parse some Latin American countries in xml, specifically the output of api.worldbank.org/V2/country?region=LCN which
we stored here. It's already saved for you in the countries temp file.

Complete get_income_distribution by reading in this file, parsing its XML and returning a dict of keys = wb:incomeLevel and values = lists of
country names (wb:name). defaultdict is a convenient data structure to use here. See also the tests for the expected return.

Good luck and code more Python!
