Bite 164. CLI tool: HTML link converter (stdin to stdout) â˜†
In this Bite you are going to help your team out automating a boring task.

They reached out to you with some data files that contain lines of (link_href, link_name). Unfortunately they also contain bad data.

The additional requirement is that your script can receive piped output from another process (read on ...)

Code up make_html_links that reads in data from stdin (use sys) and converts it to proper HTML:

Ignore the bad lines (no http in line, more than one comma, etc),
Strip white spaces around link_href and link_name,
Final twist: if the domain is NOT pybit.es or codechalleng.es make it an external link by adding target="_blank" to the resulting HTML.
Make the function print to standard output, don't return anything. The tests run your code as below and hence check standard output!
Running your program, which is automatically saved in a module called links.py, it should work like this:

$ cat data1
https://www.python.org, Python Homepage
bad data,blabla,123
https://pybit.es/generators.html , Generators are Awesome
more bad data

$ cat data1|python links.py
<a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python Homepage</a>
<a href="https://pybit.es/generators.html">Generators are Awesome</a>

$ cat data2
bogus data, again
