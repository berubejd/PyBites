"""
Bite 66. Calculate the running average of a sequence â˜†
Write a function that takes a sequence of items and returns the running average, so for example this:

running_mean([1, 2, 3])
returns:
[1, 1.5, 2]
You can assume all items are numeric so no type casting is needed.

Round the mean values to 2 decimals (4.33333 -> 4.33). See the tests for more info.

Bonus: use a function of itertools + make it a generator, but this is not required to get this working.
