Bite 47. Write a new password field validator â˜†
You know these Create a new password forms? They do a lot of checks to make sure you make a password that is hard to guess and you will surely forget.

In this Bite you will write a validator for such a form field.

Complete the validate_password function below. It takes a password str and validates that it:

is between 6 and 12 chars long (both inclusive)
has at least 1 digit [0-9]
has at least two lowercase chars [a-z]
has at least one uppercase char [A-Z]
has at least one punctuation char (use: PUNCTUATION_CHARS)
Has not been used before (use: used_passwords)
If the password matches all criteria the function should store the password in used_passwords and return True.

Have fun, keep calm and code in Python!
