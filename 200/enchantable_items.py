Bite 200. ðŸ¥³ Minecraft Enchantable Items â˜†

My kids love Minecraft and they always want me to play with them. At times
gathering resources can get boring so I sometimes deck them out with some enchanted items so that we can take on
some pillager strongholds. Although typing in the commands is relatively simple, they can get pretty long and
unwieldy!

After doing it a few times, I decided to turn to my favorite tool, Python! This bite is actually my first step in
creating a command line utility that generates the commands for me. I've already done this but I thought it would be
great to see how others would tackle the same problem. Your challenge here is to scrape
digminecraft.com (https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/enchantment_list_pc.php) for a list of enchantable items and
create a couple of classes from the information gathered.

What I'm looking for is a dictionary of Minecraft items. The page only contains information on the
enchantments so that is all we'll be focusing on. If done correctly the main()
function should print the following results:

Armor:
    [1] binding_curse
    [4] blast_protection
    [4] fire_protection
    [4] projectile_protection
    [4] protection
    [3] thorns

Axe:
    [5] bane_of_arthropods
    [5] efficiency
    [3] fortune
    [5] sharpness
    [1] silk_touch
    [5] smite

Boots:
    [3] depth_strider
    [4] feather_falling
    [2] frost_walker

Bow:
    [1] flame
    [1] infinity
    [5] power
    [2] punch

Chestplate:
    [1] mending
    [3] unbreaking
    [1] vanishing_curse

Crossbow:
    [1] multishot
    [4] piercing
    [3] quick_charge

Fishing Rod:
    [3] luck_of_the_sea
    [3] lure
    [1] mending
    [3] unbreaking
    [1] vanishing_curse

Helmet:
    [1] aqua_affinity
    [3] respiration

Pickaxe:
    [5] efficiency
    [3] fortune
    [1] mending
    [1] silk_touch
    [3] unbreaking
    [1] vanishing_curse

Shovel:
    [5] efficiency
    [3] fortune
    [1] silk_touch

Sword:
    [5] bane_of_arthropods
    [2] fire_aspect
    [2] knockback
    [3] looting
    [1] mending
    [5] sharpness
    [5] smite
    [3] sweeping
    [3] unbreaking
    [1] vanishing_curse

Trident:
    [1] channeling
    [5] impaling
    [3] loyalty
    [3] riptide


Tasks to complete:

Enchantment class


id_name: Internal name of the enchantment

name: User friendly name of the enchantment

max_level: Enchantment level. Original is in Roman numerals; they need to be converted to
integers

description: Summary of what the enchantment does

items: List of item names that are typically enchanted with this enchantment.

If, for example, the mending instance is printed, it should look like this:
Mending (1): Uses xp to mend your tools, weapons and armor

NOTE: Notice that the name is title cased, max_level is surrounded by parenthesis,
which is followed by the description.

If you print its items, it would look like this:

['sword', 'chestplate', 'pickaxe', 'fishing_rod']

NOTE: Notice that the items are not in alphabetical order! They are stored in the order in which
they are parsed from the html and are only alphabetized when the instance in printed.

Item class

name: Name of the item

enchantments: List of the enchantment instances.

If, for example, the fishing_rod object is printed, it should look like this:
Fishing Rod: 
    [3] luck_of_the_sea
    [3] lure
    [1] mending
    [3] unbreaking
    [1] vanishing_curse

NOTE: Notice that the name is title cased and that the _ has been replaced with a
space!

If you were to print each enchantment belonging to the fishing_rod, it would look like this:

Curse of Vanishing (1): Cursed item will disappear after player dies
Luck of the Sea (3): Increases chances of catching valuable items
Lure (3): Increases the rate of fish biting your hook
Mending (1): Uses xp to mend your tools, weapons and armor
Unbreaking (3): Increases durability of item

NOTE: Notice that this output is exactly like the one for the Enchantment objects, because that's
what they are.

The following functions are what you will need to complete:

generate_enchantments

This function is responsible for generating a dictionary of the Enchantment objects.


generate_items

This function is responsible for generating a dictionary of the Item objects.


Some helpful tips:

Each of the enchantments has an image in place of actual item names. The best thing that I could come up with was to
clean up the image name and extract the information from them. Removing the following from the names will do the
job: '.', '_', 'enchanted', 'iron', 'png', and 'sm'


For example, vanishing_curse has this image:


https://www.digminecraft.com/enchantments/images/sword_chestplate_pickaxe_fishing_rod_sm.png


Which would be scraped as ['sword', 'chestplate', 'pickaxe', 'fishing_rod'] for that enchantment.


NOTE: Caution must be taken here since fishing_rod is a valid item name that must
be maintained!


The titles will need some work as well. In it's raw form the titles are listed as
Aqua Affinity(aqua_affinity). You'll have to separate the two and assign them to their correct
variables: name and id_name, where the latter is the one in parenthesis.


Final Note

Pay attention to that output above. Not only are the items sorted, but also each of the item's enchantments! Don't try
and modify the output from main() as that is not used in the testing.
