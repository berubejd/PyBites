Bite 79. Parse a csv file and create a bar chart â˜†
We played a bit with the Slack API today and wow: our PyBites community is super international! We really enjoy connecting with Pythonistas from all over the globe.

We put some anonymized data in a csv (using uuid4 and faker) and for this Bite we ask you to use requests to load it in, use the csv module to parse it into a data structure of your choice, and finally produce the following output:

Africa/Algiers       | ++
Africa/Cairo         | +
Africa/Monrovia      | +
Africa/Nairobi       | ++++
...
...
Europe/Moscow        | ++
Europe/Warsaw        | ++
Pacific/Honolulu     | +
See the full output under the TESTS tab. Good luck and remember: keep calm and code in Python!
