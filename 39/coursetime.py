Bite 39. Calculate the total duration of a course â˜†
In this Bite you read in a text file with course times (MM:SS) per video.

You extract these and calculate the total course duration in HH:MM:SS.

See the docstrings and tests for more details.

Have fun and we hope you learn a thing or two.

Trivia: in honor of our Code Challenges Pilot: this was the exercise we used to test the waters when we started out :)
