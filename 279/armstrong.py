Bite 279. Armstrong numbers â˜†
In number theory there are many interesting numbers - eg. Armstrong numbers, Happy numbers, Meertens numbers, just name a few.

In this bite, you will try to solve the Armstrong number question: given an integer, determine if it is an armstrong number.

An armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. See this reference for more info and here are some examples:

a) 153 is an armstrong number. It's a 3 digits number:

    (1^3) + (5^3) + (3^3)= 153.

b) 371 is also an armstrong number.
c) any single digit numbers (1-9) are armstrong numbers as well.

    for p in str(n):
        total += int(p) ** power

    return total == n

print(is_armstrong(153))  # True
