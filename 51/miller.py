Bite 51. When does Python 2 die on Planet Miller? â˜†
Imagine you landed on Planet Miller (from the movie Interstellar) where 1 hour takes 7 Earth years (known as the gravitational time dilation effect - see here if interested).

Given a fixed start date BITE_CREATED_DT (26th of Feb 2018) calculate:

How many hours Python 2 has left on Planet Earth
How many minutes Python 2 has left on Planet Miller
As per pythonclock.org Python 2.7 will retire on 1st of Jan 2020 (after this date you can still do this Bite because we work a fixed start date.)

Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!
